# Project Setup & Environment Configuration

## Initial Setup

### Project Structure
- [x] **Initialize Project Structure**
  - [x] Create repository structure following the spec layout
  - [x] Setup frontend (Next.js) and backend (Node.js/Express) folders
  - [x] Initialize package.json, tsconfig.json for both frontend and backend

### Environment Configuration
- [x] **Environment Setup**
  - [x] Create .env.example file with required variables
  - [x] Setup secure storage for Klaviyo API key
  - [x] Configure environment variable loading (dotenv)
  - [x] Implement environment validation on startup

### Dependencies
- [x] **Dependency Installation**
  - [x] Install backend dependencies (Express, TypeScript, Jest, etc.)
  - [x] Install frontend dependencies (if not already present)
  - [x] Setup dev dependencies (ESLint, Prettier, etc.)

## CI/CD & Testing Framework

### GitHub Workflow
- [x] **GitHub Workflow Setup**
  - [x] Create .github/workflows/ci.yml for running tests and linting
  - [x] Configure workflow to run on PRs to main branch
  - [x] Add build status badge to README

### Testing Framework
- [x] **Testing Setup**
  - [x] Setup Jest/Vitest for unit testing
  - [x] Configure Supertest for API endpoint testing
  - [x] Create mock data fixtures for testing

## Version Control Best Practices

### Commit Guidelines
1. **Make Regular Commits**
   - Commit code changes frequently with descriptive commit messages
   - Follow the conventional commits pattern:
     - `feat: add date range filtering to charts`
     - `fix: resolve issue with API connection errors`
     - `docs: update testing documentation`
     - `test: add unit tests for date range filtering`
   - Reference issue numbers in commit messages when applicable
   - Keep commits focused on single logical changes

### Branch Strategy
1. **Branch Management**
   - Create feature branches for new functionality
   - Use bugfix branches for issue resolution
   - Merge back to main branch after testing
   - Delete branches after merging

2. **Branch Naming**
   - Feature branches: `feature/description`
   - Bug fixes: `fix/description`
   - Documentation: `docs/description`
   - Testing: `test/description`
