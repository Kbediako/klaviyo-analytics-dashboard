## Introduction

The Analytics Engine is designed to handle large time series datasets efficiently. Performance optimizations have been implemented at multiple levels to ensure:

- Fast response times for API requests
- Efficient memory usage
- Reduced CPU load
- Scalability with growing data volumes
- Smooth visualization experience

These optimizations are particularly important for time series data, which can grow rapidly and become challenging to manage, especially for metrics with high granularity.

## Data Downsampling

### Overview

Data downsampling reduces the number of data points while preserving the visual pattern and important features of the time series. This is crucial for efficient visualization and analysis of large datasets.

### Implemented Methods

We've implemented four downsampling methods, each with different strengths:

1. **Largest Triangle Three Buckets (LTTB)** - Default method
   - Preserves the visual shape of the data with minimal data points
   - Selects points to maximize the area of triangles formed with adjacent points
   - Optimal for visualization purposes

2. **Min-Max**
   - Preserves extremes (peaks and valleys) in each bucket
   - Good for preserving important features like spikes and drops
   - Includes both minimum and maximum values from each bucket

3. **Average**
   - Calculates the average value in each bucket
   - Smooths out noise and outliers
   - Good for general trend visualization

4. **First-Last-Significant**
   - Includes first and last points and significant points between them
   - Significance determined by change magnitude relative to range
   - Good balance between preserving patterns and reducing points

### Usage

Downsampling can be controlled via API parameters:

- `maxPoints` - Maximum number of data points to return (default varies by endpoint)
- `downsampleMethod` - Method to use ('lttb', 'min-max', 'average', 'first-last-significant')

Example API call:

```
GET /api/analytics/timeseries/metric-123?dateRange=last-90-days&maxPoints=500&downsampleMethod=lttb
```

## Chunked Processing

### Overview

Processing large arrays can lead to high memory usage and unresponsive applications. To mitigate this, we've implemented chunked processing that divides large data arrays into smaller chunks and processes them sequentially or in parallel.

### Implemented Methods

1. **Sequential Chunked Processing**
   - Processes chunks one after another
   - Yields to the event loop between chunks to maintain responsiveness
   - Good for memory-constrained environments

2. **Parallel Chunked Processing**
   - Processes multiple chunks concurrently
   - Leverages multi-core CPUs for faster processing
   - Ideal for compute-intensive operations

### Implementation Details

The chunked processing methods handle:
- Breaking large arrays into manageable chunks
- Processing each chunk with the provided function
- Combining results from all chunks
- Memory management during processing

## Computation Caching

### Overview

Many analytics computations are expensive but have results that remain valid for a period of time. The caching system stores computation results to avoid redundant calculations, significantly improving response times for repeated queries.

### Caching Strategy

1. **Time-Based Expiration**
   - Each cache entry has a time-to-live (TTL)
   - Different TTLs for different types of data
   - Automatic expiration of stale data

2. **LRU Eviction Policy**
   - Least Recently Used entries are evicted when cache is full
   - Configurable maximum entries per cache

3. **Cache Invalidation**
   - Manual invalidation through API endpoint
   - Automatic invalidation on data updates

### Cache Types

We've implemented three distinct caches:
- **Time Series Cache** - 5-minute TTL, stores raw time series data
- **Decomposition Cache** - 15-minute TTL, stores time series decompositions
- **Forecast Cache** - 30-minute TTL, stores forecast results

### Usage

Caches are automatically used by the API endpoints. To manually clear caches:

```
POST /api/analytics/clear-cache
```

## API Optimizations

### Query Parameters for Performance Control

All analytics endpoints support parameters to control performance:

1. **Data Limiting Parameters**
   - `maxPoints` - Maximum number of data points to return
   - `downsampleMethod` - Method to use for downsampling

2. **Computation Control**
   - `cacheMaxAge` - Maximum age (in seconds) for cached results

3. **Response Metadata**
   - Responses include metadata about performance optimizations:
     - `totalPoints` - Original number of data points
     - `downsampledPoints` - Number of points after downsampling
     - `wasDownsampled` - Whether downsampling was applied

### Example Response

```json
{
  "metricId": "metric-123",
  "dateRange": {
    "start": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "end": "2025-03-31T23:59:59Z"
  },
  "interval": "1 day",
  "points": [...],
  "totalPoints": 90,
  "downsampledPoints": 50,
  "wasDownsampled": true
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Visualizing a Year of Hourly Data

For a year of hourly data (8,760 points), efficient visualization might use:

```
GET /api/analytics/timeseries/metric-123?dateRange=last-year&interval=1%20hour&maxPoints=1000&downsampleMethod=lttb
```

This would downsample the data to 1,000 points using the LTTB method, preserving the visual pattern while significantly reducing data transfer and rendering time.

### Example 2: Complex Analysis with Caching

For frequent analysis of the same dataset:

```
GET /api/analytics/decomposition/metric-123?dateRange=last-quarter&interval=1%20day
```

The first request computes the decomposition and caches the result. Subsequent requests within the TTL (15 minutes) will use the cached result, providing near-instant response times.

### Example 3: Parallel Processing for Large Datasets

When analyzing multiple metrics across a large date range, the system automatically uses parallel chunked processing to distribute the computational load across available CPU cores.

## Performance Considerations

### Client-Side Rendering

Even with server-side optimizations, client-side rendering can still be a bottleneck. Consider:

- Using progressive loading techniques
- Implementing client-side caching
- Limiting the number of concurrent visualizations
- Implementing lazy loading for off-screen charts

### Data Granularity Selection

Choose appropriate data granularity based on the analysis needs:

- For long-term trends: Use daily or weekly aggregations
- For detailed analysis: Use hourly data only for shorter time periods
- For real-time monitoring: Use minute-level data for the most recent period only

### Optimization Tradeoffs

Each optimization method has tradeoffs:

- **Downsampling**: Trades some data fidelity for performance
- **Caching**: Trades data freshness for response time
- **Chunked Processing**: Trades overall completion time for responsiveness

Select the appropriate balance based on your specific needs.
