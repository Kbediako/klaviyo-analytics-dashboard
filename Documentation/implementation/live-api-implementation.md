# Live API Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of live Klaviyo API integration for the Analytics Dashboard.

## Changes Made

### API Client Updates
1. Updated `klaviyoApiClient.ts` methods to make real API calls:
   - `getCampaigns()` - Retrieves campaign data with email filter
   - `getFlows()` - Retrieves flow data with tags included
   - `getFlowMessages()` - Retrieves flow message data with date filtering
   - `getMetrics()` - Retrieves metrics data with pagination
   - `getMetricAggregates()` - Retrieves metric statistics with date filtering
   - `getProfiles()` - Retrieves customer profile data
   - `getSegments()` - Retrieves segment information
   - `getEvents()` - Retrieves event data with date filtering

2. Implemented robust error handling and rate limit protection:
   - Try/catch blocks for all API calls
   - Enhanced exponential backoff for rate limiting (429 errors)
   - Added base delay between API calls to prevent rate limits
   - Fallback to empty data arrays on error
   - Improved logging with request IDs for debugging

3. Enhanced caching for better performance:
   - Date-range aware caching in the backend
   - Pattern-based cache invalidation
   - Longer cache TTLs to prevent excessive API calls

4. Added UI loading states and indicators:
   - Skeleton loaders during data fetching
   - Status indicators for active tabs
   - Clear cache button for manual refresh
   - Live API indicator in the dashboard header

5. Added transformation logic:
   - Updated `campaignsService.ts` to transform live API responses
   - Added temporary random metrics generation for display purposes
   - Maintained fallback to mock data if API returns empty results

## Rate Limiting Improvements

### Backend (Server-side)
1. Increased retry delay from 1000ms to 2000ms
2. Increased max retries from 3 to 5
3. Added 1000ms minimum delay between API calls
4. Changed exponential backoff formula to be more aggressive
5. Added detailed logging with request IDs for debugging
6. Enhanced date-range aware caching

### Frontend (Client-side)
1. Extended refetch intervals from 5 to 30 minutes
2. Implemented request throttling with 1 second minimum between requests
3. Added deduplication of in-flight requests for the same endpoints
4. Implemented proper fallback data for all endpoints
5. Added selective cache clearing (only for affected endpoints)
6. Enhanced date range filter caching

## UI Improvements
1. Added loading state indicators to all tabs
2. Added visual indicators for active tabs with live data
3. Improved caching to prevent unnecessary API calls
4. Added "Live API" badge to indicate environment
5. Added "Clear Cache" button for manual refresh

## Testing
1. Verified API connectivity using the test API key
2. Checked proper error handling and fallback behavior
3. Confirmed date range parameters are correctly passed to API calls
4. Tested rate limit handling with multiple requests

## Next Steps
1. Create test data in Klaviyo account to verify complete functionality
2. Update remaining service transformation functions for other endpoints
3. Implement proper metrics retrieval for real statistics
4. Complete end-to-end testing with live API
5. Document any discrepancies between mock and live data

## Running with Live API
To run the application with live API integration:
```bash
./run-with-live-api.sh
```

This will start both the frontend (port 3000) and backend (port 3001) with live API connectivity.
