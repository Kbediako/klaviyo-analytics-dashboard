# Production Deployment Guide

## Prerequisites

Before deploying to production:

1. The code must have been deployed to the development environment for at least 24 hours
2. All tests must pass in the CI pipeline
3. The release must be approved by the product owner
4. A release branch must be created from the `develop` branch

## Production Deployment Process

The production deployment process is as follows:

1. Create a release branch from `develop` (e.g., `release/v1.0.0`)
2. Create a pull request to merge the release branch into `main`
3. Once approved, merge the pull request
4. Tag the release in GitHub (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
5. The production deployment workflow will automatically deploy the tagged release

## Environment Configuration

### Production Environment

- **Server**: AWS EC2 m5.large instances behind a load balancer
- **Domain**: analytics.example.com
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas (Production Cluster)
- **Caching**: ElastiCache Redis Cluster

## Monitoring and Logging

Production environment is monitored using:

- **Application Logs**: Stored in CloudWatch Logs
- **Performance Metrics**: Collected by New Relic
- **Error Tracking**: Sentry for real-time error monitoring
- **Uptime Monitoring**: Pingdom for external availability checks

## Rollback Procedure

If issues are discovered after deployment, follow these steps to roll back:

1. Identify the last stable version tag
2. Manually trigger the production deployment workflow
3. Select the stable version tag
4. Monitor the application to ensure the rollback was successful

## Deployment Checklist

Use this checklist before each production deployment:

- [ ] All tests pass in the CI pipeline
- [ ] Code has been reviewed and approved
- [ ] Documentation has been updated
- [ ] Release notes have been prepared
- [ ] Database migrations (if any) have been tested
- [ ] Backup of the current production environment has been created
- [ ] Monitoring alerts have been configured
- [ ] Rollback procedure has been reviewed

## Post-Deployment Verification

1. **Health Checks**
   - Verify all services are running
   - Check application logs for errors
   - Monitor error rates in Sentry

2. **Performance Verification**
   - Check response times
   - Monitor resource utilization
   - Verify cache hit rates

3. **Functionality Verification**
   - Test critical user flows
   - Verify API endpoints
   - Check data consistency

## Emergency Procedures

### Production Incidents

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Assess impact and severity
   - Notify stakeholders
   - Begin incident response

2. **Communication**
   - Update status page
   - Notify affected users
   - Keep team informed

3. **Resolution**
   - Implement fix or rollback
   - Verify resolution
   - Document incident

### Recovery Steps

1. **Service Recovery**
   - Restore from backup if needed
   - Verify data integrity
   - Test restored services

2. **Documentation**
   - Update runbooks
   - Document lessons learned
   - Update procedures if needed

3. **Follow-up**
   - Conduct post-mortem
   - Implement preventive measures
   - Update monitoring
