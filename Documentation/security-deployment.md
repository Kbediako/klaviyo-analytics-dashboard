## CI/CD & Deployment

### GitHub Actions Workflow
- Run on push and pull requests
- Check linting
- Run tests
- Type checking
- Security scanning
- Build verification

### Deployment Process
- Configure environment variables securely
- Use staging environment for testing
- Implement blue-green deployment
- Automated rollback capability
- Monitor deployment health

### Environment Configuration
- Use separate configurations for dev/staging/prod
- Secure secrets management
- Environment-specific optimizations
- Logging and monitoring setup
- Backup and disaster recovery plans

### Performance & Scaling
