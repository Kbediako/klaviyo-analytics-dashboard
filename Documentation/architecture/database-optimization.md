# Database Optimization Strategy

This document outlines the comprehensive database optimization strategy implemented for the Klaviyo Analytics Dashboard to ensure high performance, reliability, and scalability.

## TimescaleDB Optimizations

### Chunk Management
- Optimized chunk size to 7 days for time-series data
- Multi-dimensional partitioning using `metric_id` to improve query locality
- Compression policies for data older than 90 days to reduce storage requirements
- Retention policies to automatically manage data lifecycle

### Hypertable Configuration
```sql
SELECT create_hypertable('klaviyo_events', 'timestamp');
SELECT add_dimension('klaviyo_events', 'metric_id', number_partitions => 4);
SELECT set_chunk_time_interval('klaviyo_events', INTERVAL '7 days');
SELECT add_compression_policy('klaviyo_events', INTERVAL '90 days');
SELECT add_retention_policy('klaviyo_events', INTERVAL '2 years');
```

## Advanced Indexing Strategy

### Multi-Column Indexes
- Created composite indexes for common query patterns
- Used `INCLUDE` clause to add non-key columns to indexes without increasing index size
- Implemented covering indexes for frequently executed queries

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_klaviyo_events_metric_timestamp ON klaviyo_events (metric_id, timestamp DESC) INCLUDE (value, properties);
CREATE INDEX idx_klaviyo_events_profile_metric_timestamp ON klaviyo_events (profile_id, metric_id, timestamp DESC);
```

### BRIN Indexes
- Implemented Block Range Indexes (BRIN) for very large tables
- Optimized for time-series data where data correlates with physical storage
- Significantly smaller than B-tree indexes with good performance for range scans

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_klaviyo_events_timestamp_brin ON klaviyo_events USING BRIN (timestamp) WITH (pages_per_range = 128);
```

### GIN Indexes for JSON
- Implemented GIN (Generalized Inverted Index) for efficient JSONB querying
- Used `jsonb_path_ops` operator class for optimized containment operations
- Enables fast search within JSON properties

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_klaviyo_events_properties_gin ON klaviyo_events USING GIN (properties jsonb_path_ops);
```

### Partial Indexes
- Created partial indexes for filtered queries to reduce index size
- Focused on high-value data and active records
- Improved performance for common filtering conditions

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_klaviyo_events_high_value ON klaviyo_events (value DESC, timestamp DESC) 
WHERE value > 0;

CREATE INDEX idx_klaviyo_campaigns_active ON klaviyo_campaigns (status, send_time DESC)
WHERE status = 'active';
```

## Connection Pool Optimization

### Pool Configuration
- Dynamically sized connection pool based on workload
- Minimum connections maintained to prevent cold start latency
- Maximum connections set based on server capacity
- Idle timeout to reclaim unused connections

```typescript
// Initialize connection pool with optimized settings
this.pool = new Pool({
  host: process.env.DB_HOST || 'localhost',
  port: parseInt(process.env.DB_PORT || '5432', 10),
  user: process.env.DB_USER || 'klaviyo',
  password: process.env.DB_PASSWORD || 'klaviyo_pass',
  database: process.env.DB_NAME || 'klaviyo_analytics',
  max: maxConnections,                 // Maximum number of clients in the pool
  min: minConnections,                 // Minimum number of idle clients maintained
  idleTimeoutMillis: idleTimeout,      // Close idle clients after period of inactivity
  connectionTimeoutMillis: connectionTimeout, // Return error if connection not established
  allowExitOnIdle: false,              // Don't exit when all clients are idle
  statement_timeout: statementTimeout, // Terminate queries that run too long
});
```

### Retry Logic
- Implemented exponential backoff with jitter for connection retries
- Categorized errors to determine when retries are appropriate
- Set maximum retry attempts to prevent cascading failures

```typescript
// Calculate delay with exponential backoff and jitter
const delay = Math.min(
  this.retryConfig.maxDelay,
  this.retryConfig.initialDelay * Math.pow(this.retryConfig.factor, attempt)
);
const jitter = delay * 0.2 * Math.random();
const retryDelay = Math.round(delay + jitter);
```

### Monitoring and Metrics
- Collected real-time pool statistics
- Tracked active/idle connections and queue depth
- Set alerting thresholds for pool utilization
- Logged slow queries for performance optimization

```typescript
// Log high connection usage as warning
if (this.metrics.usage > 80) {
  logger.warn('Database connection pool usage high', {
    usage: `${Math.round(this.metrics.usage)}%`,
    active: this.metrics.active,
    max: this.metrics.maxConnections,
    waitingClients: this.metrics.waitingClients,
  });
}
```

## PostgreSQL Configuration Optimization

### Memory Settings
- Optimized shared buffers for efficient caching
- Configured work memory for complex sort operations
- Set maintenance work memory for index creation and vacuuming
- Allocated appropriate memory for effective cache size

```
# Memory Settings
shared_buffers = '2GB'               # 25% of available RAM
work_mem = '64MB'                    # For complex queries and sorts
maintenance_work_mem = '256MB'       # For maintenance operations
effective_cache_size = '6GB'         # Estimate of available memory for disk caching
```

### Query Planner Settings
- Tuned cost-based optimizer for SSD storage
- Optimized parallel query execution
- Configured statistics targets for better query plans
- Enabled partition-wise aggregation and joins

```
# Query Planner Settings
random_page_cost = 1.1               # Lower value for SSD storage
effective_io_concurrency = 200       # Higher value for SSD storage
default_statistics_target = 500      # Higher for better query plans
enable_partitionwise_join = on       # Enable partition-wise join
enable_partitionwise_aggregate = on  # Enable partition-wise aggregation
```

### Autovacuum Settings
- Aggressive configuration for large tables
- Lower scale factors for time-series data
- Higher vacuum cost limit for faster cleaning
- Shorter vacuum cost delay for more frequent operations

```
# Autovacuum Settings
autovacuum_max_workers = 4
autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor = 0.05   # More aggressive for large tables
autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor = 0.02  # More aggressive for large tables
autovacuum_vacuum_threshold = 50
autovacuum_analyze_threshold = 50
autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay = 10ms
autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit = 2000
```

## Backup and Recovery Strategy

### Backup Scheduling
- Hourly backups with 24-hour retention
- Daily backups with 7-day retention
- Weekly backups with 4-week retention
- Monthly backups with 12-month retention

### Backup Features
- Compressed backups using gzip level 9
- Metadata tracking for backup details
- Automatic backup verification
- Rotation and cleanup based on retention policy

### Recovery Procedures
- Integrity verification before restoration
- Point-in-time recovery capability
- Options for restoring to alternative databases
- Graceful handling of active connections during restore

## Query Optimization

### Statement Timeout
- Set statement timeout to prevent runaway queries
- Configured per-query timeout options
- Implemented middleware to track long-running operations

```typescript
// Add statement timeout if specified
const queryConfig = timeout 
  ? { text: `SET statement_timeout TO ${timeout}; ${text}`, values: params }
  : { text, values: params };
```

### Slow Query Logging
- Logged queries taking more than 1 second
- Tracked query execution time and row counts
- Identified repetitive slow queries for optimization

```typescript
// Log slow queries
if (duration > 1000) {
  logger.warn(`Slow query execution (${duration}ms)`, { 
    text: text.substring(0, 100),
    rows: res.rowCount 
  });
}
```
