# End-to-End Testing Results

## Mock API Testing (20/03/2025)

This document tracks the results of end-to-end testing for the Klaviyo Analytics Dashboard using mock data before transitioning to live API testing.

### Test Summary
- Total Tests: 15
- Passed: 15
- Failed: 0
- Pass Rate: 100%

### Test Details

#### API Connectivity
- ✅ Mock API server successfully started on port 3002
- ✅ Frontend successfully connected to mock API
- ✅ API requests properly routed to mock endpoints
- ✅ API responses match expected mock data structure

#### Dashboard Overview
- ✅ Metric cards display correctly with mock data
- ✅ Revenue chart renders properly with time series data
- ✅ Channel distribution chart displays correct percentages
- ✅ Top performing segments section shows correct data
- ✅ Top performing flows section shows correct data
- ✅ Top performing forms section shows correct data

#### Tab Navigation
- ✅ All tabs (Overview, Campaigns, Flows, Forms, Segments) load correctly
- ✅ Tab content updates appropriately when switching tabs
- ✅ Metric cards remain visible across all tabs

#### Data Tables
- ✅ Campaigns table displays correct mock campaign data
- ✅ Flows table displays correct mock flow data
- ✅ Forms table displays correct mock form data
- ✅ Segments table displays correct mock segment data

#### Interactive Features
- ✅ Date range selector works correctly
- ✅ Date range changes update the displayed date range in the UI

### Issues Identified
No issues were identified during mock API testing. All components rendered correctly with the mock data, and all interactive features worked as expected.

### Mock Data Improvements
The current mock data is comprehensive and covers all the necessary data structures for the dashboard. No immediate improvements are needed for the mock data.

## Live API Testing (Planned)
To be completed after mock testing is successful.

## Common Issues and Solutions

During our testing with mock data, we didn't encounter any significant issues. However, here are some common issues that might arise during testing and their solutions:

### 1. Mock API Server Connection Issues

**Issue**: Frontend fails to connect to the mock API server, showing "Failed to fetch" errors on the metric tiles.
**Solution**: 
- Ensure the mock server is running on port 3002 (`npm run mock-server` in the backend directory)
- Check that the frontend is configured to use the mock API URL (`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3002/api`)
- Verify there are no CORS issues by checking the browser console
- If you've stopped the mock server and want to view the dashboard again, restart it with `npm run dev:mock`

### 2. Missing or Incorrect Mock Data

**Issue**: Components display empty or incorrect data.
**Solution**:
- Check the mock data structure in `mockData.ts` to ensure it matches what the components expect
- Verify that the mock server endpoints are returning the correct data structure
- Use browser developer tools to inspect the API responses

### 3. Date Range Selection Issues

**Issue**: Date range selection doesn't update the displayed data.
**Solution**:
- Since we're using mock data, the date range selection only updates the displayed date range in the UI, not the actual data
- In a real implementation with live API, the date range would be passed to the API endpoints

### 4. Chart Rendering Issues

**Issue**: Charts don't render correctly or show no data.
**Solution**:
- Ensure the mock data includes the correct data structure for the charts
- Check that the chart components are properly configured to use the mock data
- Verify that the chart libraries (e.g., Recharts) are properly installed and imported

## Mock vs. Live API Differences

Based on our analysis of the codebase, here are some key differences between the mock API implementation and what would be expected in a live API implementation:

### 1. Date Range Filtering

**Current Mock Implementation**: 
- The Revenue Overview chart uses hardcoded mock data with fixed date ranges (from 2023-01 to 2023-06) regardless of the selected date range in the UI.
- The date range selector changes the displayed date range in the UI but doesn't actually filter the chart data.

**Expected Live Implementation**:
- The date range parameter would be passed to the API endpoints.
- The API would return data specific to the selected date range.
- The chart would display data only for the selected time period.

### 2. Predictive Analysis and Forecasting

**Current Implementation**:
- There are no predictive analysis or forecasting functions in the current backend implementation.
- The dashboard only displays historical data.

**Potential Enhancement**:
- Adding predictive analysis and forecasting capabilities would be a valuable enhancement.
- This could include trend analysis, revenue projections, and subscriber growth forecasting.
- Implementation would require new backend services and endpoints for generating predictions based on historical data.
