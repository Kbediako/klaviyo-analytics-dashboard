- Update this document as new requirements emerge
- Make regular commits with descriptive messages following conventional commits pattern
- For detailed implementation steps and timeline, refer to [NextSteps.md](./NextSteps.md)

## Implementation Guidelines

### Version Control Best Practices

1. **Make Regular Commits**
   - Commit code changes frequently with descriptive commit messages
   - Follow the conventional commits pattern:
     - `feat: add date range filtering to charts`
     - `fix: resolve issue with API connection errors`
     - `docs: update testing documentation`
     - `test: add unit tests for date range filtering`
   - Reference issue numbers in commit messages when applicable
   - Keep commits focused on single logical changes

2. **Branch Strategy**
   - Create feature branches for new functionality
   - Use bugfix branches for issue resolution
   - Merge back to main branch after testing
   - Delete branches after merging
