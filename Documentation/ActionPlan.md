# Klaviyo Analytics Dashboard - Implementation Action Plan

This action plan outlines the steps needed to implement the Klaviyo Analytics Dashboard backend and integrate it with the frontend. Use this document to track progress and onboard new team members.

## Project Setup & Environment Configuration

- [x] **Initialize Project Structure**
  - [x] Create repository structure following the spec layout
  - [x] Setup frontend (Next.js) and backend (Node.js/Express) folders
  - [x] Initialize package.json, tsconfig.json for both frontend and backend

- [x] **Environment Configuration**
  - [x] Create .env.example file with required variables
  - [x] Setup secure storage for Klaviyo API key
  - [x] Configure environment variable loading (dotenv)
  - [x] Implement environment validation on startup

- [x] **Dependency Installation**
  - [x] Install backend dependencies (Express, TypeScript, Jest, etc.)
  - [x] Install frontend dependencies (if not already present)
  - [x] Setup dev dependencies (ESLint, Prettier, etc.)

## CI/CD & Testing Framework

- [x] **GitHub Workflow Setup**
  - [x] Create .github/workflows/ci.yml for running tests and linting
  - [x] Configure workflow to run on PRs to main branch
  - [x] Add build status badge to README

- [x] **Testing Framework**
  - [x] Setup Jest/Vitest for unit testing
  - [x] Configure Supertest for API endpoint testing
  - [x] Create mock data fixtures for testing

## Backend API Implementation

### 1. Core Infrastructure

- [x] **API Structure**
  - [x] Create routes directory structure
  - [x] Implement middleware for error handling, logging, etc.
  - [x] Setup CORS and security middleware

- [x] **Klaviyo API Client**
  - [x] Create service for Klaviyo API authentication
  - [x] Implement base HTTP client with proper error handling
  - [x] Add retry mechanism for failed requests

- [x] **Date Range Utilities**
  - [x] Implement date range parser for formats like "last-30-days"
  - [x] Create utility for generating Klaviyo API date filters

### 2. API Endpoints

- [x] **Overview Endpoint**
  - [x] Write tests for GET /api/overview
  - [x] Implement controller and service layers
  - [x] Calculate total revenue, active subscribers, etc.
  - [x] Add period comparison logic

- [x] **Campaigns Endpoint**
  - [x] Write tests for GET /api/campaigns
  - [x] Implement controller and service layers
  - [x] Aggregate campaign metrics (open rates, click rates, etc.)
  - [x] Apply date range filtering

- [x] **Flows Endpoint**
  - [x] Write tests for GET /api/flows
  - [x] Implement controller and service layers
  - [x] Fetch flow messages and combine with events/metrics
  - [x] Calculate flow performance metrics

- [x] **Forms Endpoint**
  - [x] Write tests for GET /api/forms
  - [x] Implement controller and service layers
  - [x] Gather form views, submissions, and conversion data
  - [x] Calculate submission rates

- [x] **Segments Endpoint**
  - [x] Write tests for GET /api/segments
  - [x] Implement controller and service layers
  - [x] Get segment membership counts
  - [x] Calculate segment-specific metrics

### 3. Performance Optimization

- [x] **Caching Strategy**
  - [x] Implement response caching for expensive endpoints
  - [x] Add cache invalidation logic
  - [x] Configure cache TTL for different data types

- [x] **Rate Limiting**
  - [x] Research Klaviyo API rate limits
  - [x] Implement request throttling to avoid rate limits
  - [x] Add queuing mechanism for large batch requests
