# Live API Testing Preparation

## Setup Tasks

- [x] **Configure environment for live API testing**
  - Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with a valid Klaviyo API key
  - Verify API key permissions and access levels
  - Document any rate limiting considerations

- [x] **Update mock data implementation**
  - Updated mock-data.js to use export default pattern for better module compatibility
  - Modified mockServer.js to handle the data properly
  - Updated run-with-mock-server.sh to use fixed ports
  - Created knowledge-transfer document for context

- [x] **Update API client for live testing**
  - Updated `backend/src/services/klaviyoApiClient.ts` with live API endpoints for all methods
  - Implemented error handling and retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
  - Added logging to track API responses during testing
  - Updated campaignsService.ts to transform live API data

- [ ] **Create test data in Klaviyo account**
  - Set up test campaigns, flows, forms, and segments in the Klaviyo account
  - Document test data IDs and expected metrics for verification
  - Create a variety of test scenarios

## Testing Tasks

- [ ] **Run initial live API tests**
  - Start the application with `npm run dev:all`
  - Test each endpoint individually to verify connectivity
  - Document any discrepancies between mock and live data

- [ ] **Perform comprehensive end-to-end testing with live API**
  - Follow the testing process documented in `TestResults.md`
  - Compare results with mock testing
  - Document any issues or differences

- [ ] **Update documentation with live testing results**
  - Complete the "Live API Testing" section in `TestResults.md`
  - Update the "Mock vs. Live API Differences" section with actual findings
  - Document any performance considerations

## Implementation Details

### Environment Setup
1. Create `.env` file with required variables:
   ```
   KLAVIYO_API_KEY=your_api_key
   API_BASE_URL=https://a.klaviyo.com/api
   ```
2. Configure rate limiting settings
3. Set up error logging
4. Configure monitoring tools

### Test Data Requirements
1. Campaigns:
   - At least one active campaign
   - One completed campaign
   - One scheduled campaign

2. Flows:
   - Welcome series flow
   - Abandoned cart flow
   - Re-engagement flow

3. Forms:
   - Newsletter signup form
   - Pop-up form
   - Embedded form

4. Segments:
   - VIP customers
   - Active subscribers
   - Recent purchasers

### Testing Process
1. Verify API connectivity
2. Test each endpoint individually
3. Run end-to-end tests
4. Document results and issues
5. Compare with mock data
6. Update documentation
